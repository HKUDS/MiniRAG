This is the first paragraph of our sample text file. It contains a few sentences to demonstrate the loading and processing capabilities of the RAG system. We aim to chunk this text into meaningful segments.

The second paragraph provides more content. RAG systems often benefit from well-defined document chunks. These chunks are then vectorized and stored in a database for efficient retrieval. Proper chunking strategy is crucial for retrieval accuracy.

Finally, the third paragraph concludes this sample document. It's a short document, but sufficient for initial testing of the data processing pipeline. Future enhancements could include handling various file formats like PDF, DOCX, or even web URLs.
The RAG model will use these chunks to find relevant information.
